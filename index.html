        <h1>Welcome to Our Study on Dark Patterns</h1>
        <p>This interactive study is designed to educate and gather insights on 'Dark Patterns' in web design. Dark patterns are deceptive User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI) tactics used to influence user behavior online. These manipulative practices can range from subtle trickery to outright deception.</p>
        <p>Your consent may be withdrawn at any time, this study is completely voluntary and you will not be penalized for ending your participation.</p>
        
        <p><b>Examples of Dark Patterns:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bait and Switch:</b> The user sets out to do one thing, but a different, undesirable thing happens instead.</li>
            <li><b>Hidden Costs:</b> Additional charges are revealed only at the final stage of a transaction.</li>
            <li><b>Misdirection:</b> Focusing the user's attention on one thing to distract their attention from another.</li>
            <!-- Add more examples as needed -->
        </ul>

        <p>Explore various scenarios and identify these manipulative practices as you proceed through the study. You are encouraged to talk aloud to narrate your actions and intutions realtime as you progress, but don't think about or explain your actions. We will have a follow-up interview to discuss your experience.</p>
        <p><b>Do not enter personally-identifying information into the system.</b></p>
